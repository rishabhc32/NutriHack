# NutriHack
We are making an app to show nutrient information of food. With advent of easy access to junk food we have spoiled our eating habits. Which leads to health diseases like diabetes and obesity.

Therefore to get easy access to nutrient information of food we are making our app __NutriHack__. 

This is how it will work:
* User clicks the photo of the food.
* The picture is processed and send to servers.
* With some ML and server magic we identify the food.
* The food's nutrient information is sent back to user.
